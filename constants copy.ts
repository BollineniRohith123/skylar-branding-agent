        prompt: "Professional aviation photography: Brand new Airbus A350-900 with PURE WHITE LIVERY (brilliant white base paint, Pantone White or RAL 9016 equivalent) positioned on the tarmac at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport Terminal 2 during the golden hour (30 minutes before sunset). The aircraft features a pristine white fuselage and white tail fin, ensuring maximum contrast and visibility for the brand logo application. Shot from a low angle using a Canon EOS-1D X Mark III with a 24-70mm f/2.8 lens at 35mm, f/5.6, creating a heroic perspective that emphasizes the aircraft's scale and modern design. The pure white fuselage prominently displays the provided logo as clean, professional aircraft branding - simple and elegant without additional text or graphics (following aviation industry standards where less is more). The logo should be perfectly scaled and positioned prominently on the forward fuselage section (approximately 6m x 4m logo size on the front fuselage, positioned behind the cockpit windows for optimal visibility). The white tail fin should also display the logo in a coordinated size and position (approximately 4m x 3m logo size centered on the tail fin). The entire branding treatment should appear as premium vinyl wrap installation on the brilliant white surface with realistic light reflections, flawless finish quality, and the sophisticated simplicity characteristic of high-end aircraft livery designs—the white background ensures the logo colors stand out with perfect clarity and maximum visual impact. The wet tarmac from recent monsoon rain creates mirror-like reflections of the pristine white aircraft and the dramatic sky painted in warm orange, pink, and purple hues characteristic of Mumbai coastal sunsets. The white aircraft reflects the golden sunset colors beautifully, creating a stunning interplay of warm light on the clean white surface. Include authentic airport details: ground crew in Air India uniforms performing safety checks, GPU (ground power unit) connected to aircraft, orange safety cones positioned correctly, Terminal 2's distinctive peacock-inspired architecture visible in the background, Airbus winglets with proper aerodynamic design, realistic aircraft registration numbers (black text on white fuselage), and the authentic busy atmosphere of India's second-busiest airport. The lighting should capture the natural golden hour warmth with soft shadows under the aircraft belly, realistic reflections on the glossy white fuselage showing warm sunset tones, the logo appearing vibrant and perfectly readable against the white background, and the characteristic gradient of sunset colors washing over the aircraft. The white paint should appear pristine and well-maintained, showing subtle variations in tone from the golden light (warmer tones on sun-facing surfaces, cooler tones in shadows) while maintaining the overall brilliant white appearance. The image must have the professional quality of aerospace marketing photography with natural film grain texture (Kodak Portra 400 aesthetic), sharp focus on the logo branding, and depth of field that keeps the aircraft sharp while gently blurring the background Terminal 2 architecture. The white livery creates a premium, clean aesthetic perfect for showcasing brand logos with maximum visibility and impact. Avoid any CGI or over-processed digital appearance.",

        prompt: "Professional aircraft interior photography: Interior of a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner business class cabin at cruising altitude (35,000 feet) over the Indian subcontinent during late afternoon flight from Mumbai to Singapore. Shot from a passenger seat perspective using a Sony A7R IV with a 24mm f/1.4 lens at f/2.8, ISO 800, 1/125s to balance the bright window light with cabin ambiance. The camera angle is tilted upward at approximately 45 degrees, focusing on the 'skyline panel' - a continuous horizontal advertising banner (12m x 0.4m) mounted above the large panoramic windows displaying a COMPLETE PROFESSIONAL ADVERTISEMENT DESIGN. The skyline panel should feature: the provided logo as the central focal point, a sophisticated brand tagline in elegant typography flowing horizontally alongside the logo, subtle decorative elements (refined geometric patterns, soft gradients, or minimalist design accents) that enhance readability while maintaining premium aesthetics, and the overall design should look like a high-end advertising agency mockup with perfect visual balance and sophisticated color integration that complements the cabin's luxury ambiance. The advertisement should be backlit with professional LED illumination creating an elegant glow. The cabin showcases authentic Boeing 787 design elements: electrochromic window dimming technology showing a mid-tint blue state, curved composite ceiling panels with integrated LED mood lighting in warm amber tones (2700K), premium leather seats in cream and navy blue with visible natural grain texture and subtle wear patterns indicating quality materials. Include realistic passenger details: business executive in crisp white formal shirt and navy blazer reading The Economic Times newspaper with visible Hindi headlines, middle-aged woman in elegant silk saree (peacock blue with gold border) gazing out the window with soft window light illuminating her profile, two flight attendants in Singapore Airlines sarong kebaya uniforms (batik pattern) pushing the beverage cart down the aisle with professional posture and genuine smiles. The windows reveal the authentic view of 35,000 feet altitude: deep indigo sky transitioning to golden orange near the horizon, stratospheric perspective showing the Earth's curvature, realistic cumulus cloud formations far below casting natural shadows on the landscape, and the characteristic soft glow of late afternoon sunlight. The lighting creates a sophisticated interplay: natural sunlight streaming through the large windows creating defined shadows on the seat headrests, the warm LED cabin lighting reflecting off polished surfaces, and the backlit skyline panel advertisement glowing with professional illumination. Include authentic cabin details: individual air vents above each seat with brushed aluminum finish, articulated reading lights, overhead compartments with soft-close mechanisms, safety equipment cards in seat pockets, tray tables with woodgrain laminate finish, and the characteristic curved wall design of the 787 composite fuselage. The depth of field should keep the skyline panel advertisement in sharp focus while creating a natural bokeh effect on passengers in the background.

Shot from a low position in the main aisle (approximately 1.2m height) using a Canon EOS R5 with a 16-35mm f/2.8 lens at 20mm, f/4, ISO 1600, 1/100s to capture the dynamic boarding atmosphere with natural motion blur. The camera angle is tilted upward at 60 degrees, creating a dramatic perspective that emphasizes the overhead compartments while capturing the full height of the cabin. The overhead bin panels feature large rectangular advertisement spaces (80cm x 30cm per bin) displaying COMPLETE PROFESSIONAL ADVERTISEMENT DESIGNS - not just logo stickers. Each overhead bin panel should showcase: the provided logo as the prominent focal point, a concise brand tagline or key message in clear, bold typography positioned strategically, subtle background gradients or modern geometric patterns in brand colors that enhance visual appeal without cluttering, and the overall design should look like a professional advertising campaign with strong visual hierarchy optimized for quick viewing from aisle perspective. The advertisement should be printed on high-quality adhesive vinyl with matte anti-glare finish, showing professional installation with perfect alignment and no bubbles or edges, creating maximum brand impact at viewing distance. The cabin is filled with authentic boarding activity: businessman in charcoal gray suit and burgundy tie reaching up to place his Samsonite laptop bag in the overhead bin (capture the natural stretch of his arm and focused expression), young family with two children aged 6 and 9 settling into row 12 seats with the mother organizing colorful backpacks and the father helping the kids with seatbelts, elderly Punjabi couple in traditional attire (man in cream kurta, woman in pink salwar kameez) carefully organizing their carry-on luggage with visible care and attention, and a flight attendant in IndiGo uniform (navy blue with distinctive pattern) assisting a passenger three rows back. The cabin lighting creates a sophisticated atmosphere: cool blue LED strips (5000K) running along the overhead compartments' edges providing the primary illumination, warm reading lights (3000K) creating accent pools of light on passengers' heads and shoulders, and the natural interplay of shadows and highlights on the curved composite ceiling panels. Include authentic Airbus A320neo details: the characteristic curved ceiling design with smooth composite panels, PSU (Passenger Service Unit) panels with individual air vents showing brushed aluminum finish, emergency equipment compartments with clear safety labeling in English and Hindi, the Sky Interior design philosophy with enhanced sense of space, slim-line seats with blue leather headrests showing the texture and professional upholstery, overhead compartment latches with the distinctive Airbus pivot mechanism, and reading light controls with tactile buttons. The composition should capture the natural flow and organized chaos of boarding: some passengers already seated reading newspapers or checking phones, others moving down the aisle with roller bags, the characteristic narrow aisle perspective of a single-aisle aircraft, and the professional efficiency of the boarding process. Show realistic details like: passengers' varied expressions (concentration, mild stress, casual chatting), natural body language and postures, the mix of business and leisure travelers, diverse luggage types (hard-shell roller bags, soft duffels, laptop bags, duty-free shopping bags), and the authentic lighting reflections on the polished overhead bin surfaces. The image must capture the modern air travel experience with photography quality matching airline marketing campaigns - emphasizing the premium cabin environment, the effective visibility of the overhead bin advertisement, and the professional atmosphere of contemporary aviation.",

        prompt: "Professional luxury detail photography: Macro shot of a premium business class seat headrest in an Emirates Airbus A380 upper deck business class cabin. Shot using a Nikon Z9 with a Nikkor 105mm f/2.8 Macro lens at f/4, ISO 400, 1/200s, creating a shallow depth of field that keeps the headrest in sharp focus while gently blurring the background. The camera is positioned at eye level, approximately 60cm from the headrest, capturing the intimate detail and craftsmanship. The headrest cover features luxurious Italian Poltrona Frau leather in Emirates' signature cream color (Pantone 9183C) with visible natural grain texture, subtle variations in the leather surface showing organic patterns, and delicate patina indicating premium quality materials. The provided logo is embroidered in the center of the headrest (positioned 8cm from the top edge) using high-quality metallic gold thread (Madeira Classic No. 40) with approximately 12,000 stitches, showing professional embroidery craftsmanship with perfect tension, clean edges, and three-dimensional thread texture that catches light. The embroidery depth is approximately 2mm, creating subtle shadows and highlights that give the logo dimensional presence. The logo measures 8cm x 5cm, perfectly centered and aligned. The lighting is sophisticated and directional: the primary light source is the adjustable reading light mounted above the seat, positioned at a 45-degree angle, creating soft highlights on the raised embroidery threads and gentle shadows in the leather grain texture. This creates a chiaroscuro effect that emphasizes the tactile nature of both materials. Secondary ambient cabin lighting (warm LED at 2800K) provides subtle fill light, preventing harsh shadows while maintaining the premium atmosphere. Include authentic Emirates A380 business class details visible in the sharp focus zone: the headrest adjustment mechanism on the right side showing brushed aluminum controls with Arabic and English labels, small precision stitching along the edges of the leather cover (1.5mm spacing) in matching cream thread, the subtle Emirates logo embossed on the adjustment mechanism, and the characteristic curve of the headrest design following ergonomic principles. The background (beautifully out of focus with creamy bokeh) reveals adjacent seats with similar headrests, the curved cabin walls finished in champagne metallic panels, hints of the entertainment screen, the characteristic Emirates red and gold accent colors on cabin elements, and the soft ambient glow of cabin lighting. Show realistic material details: natural leather grain patterns with micro-variations in surface texture, the way light interacts with the leather surface creating subtle sheen without appearing plastic or artificial, individual embroidery thread fibers visible under close inspection, the slight compression marks on the leather from previous passenger use (indicating authentic wear), and the professional quality of the leather finishing with no visible seams or imperfections in the focal area. The composition should evoke a tactile response - making viewers want to reach out and feel the premium materials. The depth of field should transition gradually from sharp focus on the embroidered logo (critical focus point) to soft blur on the background elements (bokeh circles from cabin lights). The image must capture the essence of first-class luxury air travel with photography quality that rivals high-end fashion editorials or luxury brand advertising - emphasizing craftsmanship, material quality, attention to detail, and the premium experience that Emirates is known for globally.",

        prompt: "Professional architectural and advertising photography: Interior of Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport Terminal 2 ('Garden Terminal'), captured during mid-morning hours when natural light is optimal. Shot using a Sony A1 with a 24mm f/1.4 GM lens at f/5.6, ISO 400, 1/250s, positioned at ground level to capture both the soaring architecture and the human scale of the space. The camera angle is slightly elevated (1.8m height on a tripod) to showcase the terminal's depth and the innovative ceiling design. The focal point is a sleek vertical digital advertising kiosk (3.6m height x 1.2m width, HD LED display with 2.5mm pixel pitch) displaying a COMPLETE PROFESSIONAL ADVERTISEMENT DESIGN at 4K resolution with perfect color calibration (100% sRGB). The digital advertisement should feature: the provided logo as the dominant centerpiece, a compelling brand tagline or key message in bold, modern typography, eye-catching visual elements (vibrant gradients, dynamic patterns, or lifestyle imagery) that create visual impact, contact information or website URL positioned strategically, and the overall design should look like a professional advertising agency digital campaign with sophisticated motion graphics elements (if animated) or striking static composition with perfect visual hierarchy optimized for quick comprehension by passing travelers. The kiosk features a brushed aluminum frame with integrated ambient lighting and professional installation quality. The kiosk is strategically positioned in the departure hall's main circulation area, surrounded by the terminal's signature biophilic design: lush tropical plants including banana trees (Musa acuminata, 3-4m height), bird's nest ferns (Asplenium nidus), Boston ferns in hanging planters, flowering orchids (Dendrobium and Vanda varieties in white and purple), Monstera deliciosa with large fenestrated leaves, and vertical garden walls with mixed native Indian flora. The terminal's revolutionary bamboo-finished ceiling soars 15 meters above, featuring an intricate lattice pattern of sustainably sourced bamboo creating a distinctive wave-like structure that filters natural sunlight through large skylights. This creates beautiful dappled light patterns (chiaroscuro effect) across the polished Jaisalmer Yellow granite floor, with shadows shifting throughout the space mimicking the experience of walking through a forest canopy. The background captures authentic terminal activity: young family (parents in casual business attire with two children aged 5 and 8) pulling roller luggage past the display, pointing and looking up at the kiosk; business traveler in suit checking his smartphone while walking; elderly couple in traditional South Indian attire (man in white dhoti and shirt, woman in silk Kanjivaram saree) consulting a paper boarding pass; airport staff in the distinctive green and white Terminal 2 uniform assisting a passenger; and groups of international travelers with varied luggage moving through the space. Show the terminal's award-winning sustainable design elements: the distinctive curved roof structure with its innovative bamboo lattice creating organic patterns against the sky; floor-to-ceiling glass walls (18m height) allowing maximum natural light penetration; modern seating areas with furniture made from reclaimed teak wood and natural fiber upholstery; living plant walls (7m x 4m sections) with automated irrigation systems; and the characteristic terracotta accent walls inspired by Karnataka's traditional architecture. The lighting creates a sophisticated atmosphere: primary natural light from the massive skylights creating soft, diffused illumination with a color temperature of 5500K; warm LED accent lights (3000K) highlighting the plant areas and creating pools of light; uplighting on the bamboo ceiling creating dramatic shadows and emphasizing the architectural geometry; and the bright, vibrant glow from the digital kiosk cutting through the natural lighting (6500K) making it the clear focal point. Include realistic architectural details: the polished granite floor showing subtle natural stone variations and realistic reflections of the plants, kiosk, and passengers; the floor pattern transitioning from dark gray stone in circulation areas to lighter tones near seating; modern wayfinding signage in Kannada, Hindi, and English with the airport's distinctive green branding; retail shops visible in the background with sustainable bamboo facades; and the serene, almost meditative atmosphere that has earned this terminal multiple international design awards. Show realistic environmental details: slight motion blur on walking passengers (1/250s shutter capturing natural movement); the interplay of shadows and light across different surfaces; realistic color grading that emphasizes the natural green tones of the plants against the warm bamboo and neutral stone; and the authentic busy-yet-calm atmosphere of a premium Indian airport. The composition should use the rule of thirds with the digital kiosk positioned on the right third, the bamboo ceiling creating leading lines drawing the eye through the frame, and the lush greenery framing the advertisement. The depth of field should keep both the foreground kiosk and the architectural details in the background reasonably sharp (f/5.6 provides sufficient depth). The image must capture both the cutting-edge advertisement technology and Terminal 2's revolutionary sustainable architecture, creating a photograph worthy of architecture magazines like Architectural Digest while effectively showcasing the advertising opportunity - emphasizing innovation, sustainability, premium passenger experience, and the unique character of India's most environmentally advanced airport terminal.",

Shot using a Canon EOS R5 with a 85mm f/1.4 lens at f/2.8, ISO 400, 1/250s, creating a shallow depth of field that keeps the boarding pass in sharp focus while beautifully blurring the background into creamy bokeh. The camera is positioned at a natural eye level (1.6m height), angled slightly downward at 15 degrees to capture the boarding pass as it would naturally be held and viewed. The boarding pass (standard thermal paper, 21cm x 8cm) is positioned at a slight angle (approximately 25 degrees from horizontal) showing the back side prominently. The hands holding the boarding pass belong to a business professional - well-manicured hands (professional manicure, clear or subtle nude polish, no excessive jewelry except a simple gold wedding band on left hand) with natural skin tone (Indian wheat complexion), fingers positioned naturally and relaxed showing the authentic way someone holds a boarding pass while reading it. The grip is secure but not tense, with thumb on top and fingers supporting from below. The back side of the boarding pass features a COMPLETE PROFESSIONAL ADVERTISEMENT DESIGN printed in the center (12cm x 5cm area), using offset printing technique with vibrant CMYK colors showing perfect registration, sharp edges, and premium finish quality. The advertisement design should include: the provided logo as the central focal point (6cm x 4cm), a concise brand tagline or key message in clear, readable typography positioned below the logo, subtle background elements (gentle gradients, minimal geometric patterns, or brand colors) that enhance the design without cluttering the limited space, and contact information or QR code for engagement, creating a complete mini-advertisement optimized for the boarding pass format. The front edge of the boarding pass (partially visible) shows authentic IndiGo branding: the distinctive orange and blue color scheme, IndiGo logo, and thermal-printed flight details. Include realistic boarding pass details on the front edge: Flight number '6E 2347', Route 'DEL → BOM' (Delhi to Mumbai using authentic IATA airport codes), Departure time '14:45', Gate number 'D7', Seat number '12A', Passenger name 'SHARMA/PRIYA', Booking reference 'J8K5M2', Date '15 NOV 2025', boarding time '14:15', and Class 'Economy'. Show the characteristic IndiGo thermal paper texture with the subtle glossy finish, the perforation line on the left edge where the baggage tag was removed, and the 2D barcode at the bottom (Data Matrix format). The paper shows realistic characteristics: slight curl at the edges from the thermal printing process, subtle texture of the thermal paper surface, crisp black text from thermal printer (300 DPI quality), and the characteristic white-to-slight-cream color of airport thermal paper. The background (beautifully out of focus with f/2.8 bokeh) reveals a modern Indian airport terminal environment: blurred shapes of other passengers walking with luggage creating natural bokeh circles and light patterns, the soft glow of airport lighting creating warm highlights, hints of retail shops with colorful signage rendered as abstract light shapes, modern terminal architecture with its characteristic bright and airy feeling, and the overall atmosphere of a busy departure area. The lighting is sophisticated airport terminal lighting: bright, even overhead LED lighting (4000K color temperature) providing the primary illumination without harsh shadows, creating a clean and professional look; subtle highlights on the glossy thermal paper surface showing its texture; soft shadows under the fingers holding the pass indicating natural depth; and slight rim lighting from large terminal windows (diffused daylight at 5500K) creating a subtle backlight that separates the hands from the background. Show realistic details that add authenticity: natural skin texture on the hands including fine lines and realistic pores, subtle shadows cast by the fingers on the boarding pass surface, the slight transparency of the thin thermal paper allowing backlight to subtly show through, realistic reflection of ambient light on the glossy printed area, slight imperfections like a tiny corner crease indicating the pass has been handled, and natural color grading that matches airport photography aesthetics (clean, bright, professional). The composition should use the rule of thirds with the logo positioned in the center-left third of the frame, the hands and boarding pass creating a natural diagonal line leading the eye, and negative space on the right side balanced by the blurred terminal background. The depth of field transition should be gradual and natural, with sharp focus on the logo and text, decreasing to soft blur at the edges of the boarding pass, and beautiful creamy bokeh in the background. The image must convey premium quality and authenticity, making it look like a real promotional partnership between the airline and the advertised brand - emphasizing the tangible, high-quality nature of the boarding pass advertisement, the professional printing quality, and the natural integration into the air travel experience. The photography quality should match airline marketing campaigns and product advertising standards, creating an image that brands would be proud to showcase as evidence of their advertising reach.",

Shot using a Nikon D850 with a 70-200mm f/2.8 lens at 120mm, f/8, ISO 200, 1/500s to freeze the action and ensure both foreground and background elements are sharp in the bright tropical sunlight. The camera is positioned approximately 30 meters from the aircraft at ground level, creating a dynamic three-quarter angle that captures both the boarding activity and the aircraft in context. The central focus is a mobile aircraft passenger step ladder (air stairs) - a professional aluminum structure with 12 steps, safety railings, and wheels, positioned against an ATR 72-600 aircraft. The ladder's side panels (2.5m x 1.2m on each side) feature a COMPLETE PROFESSIONAL ADVERTISEMENT DESIGN prominently displayed on both sides. Each panel should showcase: the provided logo as the focal point (60cm x 40cm positioned centrally), a concise brand tagline or key message in bold, clear typography positioned below the logo, vibrant background elements using brand colors with subtle gradients or geometric patterns that create visual interest, contact information or website URL in smaller text at the bottom, and the overall design should look like a professional outdoor advertising panel with high contrast colors that ensure visibility against the bright tropical sky and tarmac, optimized for viewing by passengers boarding the aircraft. The advertisement is printed on weather-resistant vinyl with laminated UV protection showing vibrant Pantone-matched colors, sharp graphics maintaining clarity at close inspection distance, and professional mounting with no bubbles or wrinkles. The scene captures authentic Indian regional airport atmosphere during peak boarding: a young family (father in linen shirt, mother in floral sundress, two children aged 7 and 10 in bright tourist clothing) ascending the stairs with colorful luggage (one bright orange backpack, one yellow roller bag), the children looking back excited; a couple of tourists in beachwear (shorts, t-shirts, sunglasses, flip-flops) carrying beach bags and shopping bags from Goan markets; a business traveler in wrinkled white shirt (traveling to Mumbai) checking his phone while climbing; and elderly couple being assisted by cabin crew. At the base of the stairs, two airport ground staff in khaki uniforms with orange safety vests and white caps are managing boarding, one checking boarding passes, the other directing passengers - their uniforms showing the realistic wear of outdoor work. The ATR 72-600 shows authentic details: the distinctive turboprop engines with their large five-blade propellers (Pratt & Whitney engines), the high-wing configuration characteristic of ATR aircraft, airline livery (IndiGo or Alliance Air regional service), visible aircraft registration number on the fuselage, open main door with cabin crew member visible inside welcoming passengers, cockpit windows with sun visors partially down, and the aircraft's white and blue/red color scheme reflecting the harsh sunlight. The background reveals authentic Goan coastal airport atmosphere: the terminal building (Dabolim's distinctive modern architecture with Portuguese-influenced design elements, cream and terracotta colors, and arched details), palm trees (Coconut palms, 15-20m height) swaying in the coastal breeze, the characteristic red laterite soil of Goa visible around the terminal, ground support equipment (baggage cart loaded with colorful tourist luggage, GPU unit, fuel truck in distance), and the Goan hills visible on the horizon with characteristic green tropical vegetation. The lighting is the harsh, brilliant tropical sun of Goa at midday (11:30 AM) creating high-contrast conditions: direct sunlight at approximately 70-degree angle creating crisp, dark shadows on the tarmac under the aircraft and ladder, strong highlights on the metallic aluminum surface of the stairs creating natural reflections and glints, the advertisement vinyl showing slight gloss from the laminated surface catching light, passengers squinting slightly in the bright sun (authentic reaction), and the characteristic bright, washed-out sky of intense tropical sunlight (pale blue with white haze near horizon). The tarmac shows realistic details: dark gray asphalt with visible texture and weathering, heat haze rising from the surface (characteristic distortion in the distance visible at 1/500s), tire marks and oil stains indicating regular airport operations, yellow safety markings for aircraft parking position, and shadows with hard edges due to the overhead sun. Include authentic environmental details: slight motion blur on the propellers if the APU is running (visible as slight transparency), cabin crew member's uniform (precise airline colors and styling), realistic luggage variety (hard-shell rollers, fabric duffels, backpacks, duty-free bags), passenger expressions showing a mix of excitement and tropical heat fatigue, and the natural body language of people climbing stairs while carrying luggage. The atmosphere captures the unique character of Goan airport experience: the transition between beach vacation and air travel, the casual yet organized feeling of regional airport operations, the mix of domestic tourists, international travelers, and business passengers, and the distinctly Indian blend of efficiency and laid-back coastal culture. The composition should use the rule of thirds with the advertisement-branded ladder positioned on the left third, the aircraft creating a strong diagonal line leading to the top-right, and the terminal building providing context in the background. The image must be sharp, clear, and perfectly exposed despite the challenging high-contrast lighting - using the same technical excellence as professional airline marketing photography or advertising agency client presentations. The final image should make the ladder advertisement the clear focal point while capturing the authentic essence of regional air travel in India, demonstrating both the visibility and impact of this advertising medium in a real-world aviation environment.",

The background reveals RGIA's award-winning terminal architecture: soaring ceiling (20m height) with distinctive contemporary design featuring geometric patterns and integrated LED lighting strips creating a modern aesthetic, massive floor-to-ceiling glass curtain walls allowing views of the lit airside apron, polished Rajasthan pink granite floors (mirror finish) reflecting the overhead lights and creating beautiful reflections of trolleys and passengers, modern wayfinding signage in English and Telugu with the airport's orange and blue branding scheme, the vast open space of the arrivals hall emphasizing the terminal's scale and modern design, and arrivals processing counters visible in the distance with customs and immigration facilities. The lighting creates a sophisticated contemporary atmosphere: bright, even LED overhead lighting (4500K color temperature) throughout the terminal providing consistent illumination that eliminates harsh shadows, creating a clean professional look; linear LED strips integrated into ceiling architecture creating geometric patterns of light; the polished floor reflecting overhead lights creating a bright, pristine environment; slight reflections on the stainless steel trolley surfaces showing the terminal lights as bright points; and the characteristic cool-toned lighting of modern airport design creating a crisp, high-tech atmosphere. The stainless steel trolleys create beautiful reflections: distorted mirror reflections showing the terminal ceiling and lights, the advertisement panel visible in reflection on adjacent trolley's surface, realistic surface imperfections like minor scratches and fingerprints (indicating regular use without appearing dirty), and the interplay of brushed and polished steel surfaces creating texture variation. Include authentic environmental details that add realism: slight motion blur on passengers walking in the background (1/125s captures movement), natural postures and body language of travelers after a long flight (slight fatigue, relief, purposeful movement), diverse luggage types representing different traveler demographics (premium brand roller bags, traditional Indian trunks, shopping bags from Hyderabad stores, duty-free bags), realistic wear patterns on the trolleys indicating regular use while maintaining clean, maintained appearance, and the professional operation and maintenance standards visible throughout. Show the terminal's sophisticated ambiance: the cleanliness and organization expected of a major international hub, modern digital displays showing flight information and advertisements, the characteristic blend of efficiency and service in Indian airport operations, subtle branding elements throughout the space (RGIA and GMR Group identifiers), and the premium experience that has earned this airport numerous international awards. The composition should use the rule of thirds with the front advertising panel positioned in the left third of frame creating the clear focal point, the line of trolleys creating leading lines drawing the eye deeper into the terminal, and the background architectural elements providing context and scale. The depth of field (f/4) should keep the front advertisement panel and trolley in sharp focus while creating a gradual blur on background elements, maintaining context without distraction. The image must look crisp, clean, and professional - matching the quality of airport authority marketing materials or advertising agency presentations. The final photograph should simultaneously showcase the advertising medium's effectiveness (clear visibility, prominent placement, professional presentation) and the premium environment of modern Indian aviation infrastructure (world-class facilities, efficient operations, contemporary design), creating an image that demonstrates strong ROI for potential advertisers while capturing the authentic energy and scale of one of India's most acclaimed international airports.",

        prompt: "Professional outdoor advertising and automotive photography: Wide-angle shot of a massive unipole billboard installation on the Hyderabad Outer Ring Road (ORR) near Gachibowli IT corridor during late afternoon (4:30 PM). Shot using a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV with a 16-35mm f/2.8 lens at 18mm, f/11, ISO 200, 1/500s to capture both the towering structure and the surrounding environment with maximum depth of field. The camera is positioned low (0.6m height) on the highway shoulder approximately 40 meters from the unipole base, creating a dramatic upward angle that emphasizes the structure's monumental scale and power. The unipole structure is a modern outdoor advertising installation: single steel pole (2.5m diameter, painted in neutral gray) rising 18 meters from ground level, supporting a massive billboard frame (12m width x 6m height) displaying a COMPLETE PROFESSIONAL BILLBOARD ADVERTISEMENT DESIGN—this is a full advertising campaign mockup, NOT just a logo placement. The billboard must showcase a comprehensive advertisement featuring: the provided logo as the dominant focal point (4m x 2.5m) positioned strategically in the center or upper-center of the billboard; a powerful brand tagline or key marketing message in large, bold typography that's readable from highway distances (minimum 60cm letter height) positioned prominently near the logo; eye-catching visual elements including high-quality product photography, lifestyle imagery showing people using the product/service, or striking graphic patterns with vibrant color gradients that create immediate visual impact and fill the entire billboard space; complementary design elements like geometric shapes, abstract patterns, or decorative accents in brand colors creating a cohesive visual identity; background design using sophisticated gradients, textures, or imagery that supports the brand message without overwhelming; contact information (website URL or phone number) in appropriate size at the bottom of the billboard; and the overall design should follow professional outdoor advertising best practices—minimal text (7 words or less for primary message), high contrast colors optimized for daylight visibility, clear visual hierarchy with logo and tagline as primary elements, balanced composition that fills the entire 12m x 6m space, and sophisticated design that commands attention from drivers traveling at highway speeds. The billboard should look like a complete advertising agency campaign presentation with logo, headline, visuals, and call-to-action all working together as a unified design. The billboard uses backlit flex material (translucent for internal LED illumination) or high-quality vinyl print with UV-resistant lamination, showing vibrant Pantone-matched colors, sharp graphics at viewing distance, professional installation with perfect tension and no wrinkles, and the complete advertisement design clearly visible demonstrating the brand's full visual identity and marketing message. The structure shows realistic engineering details: visible steel I-beam frame supporting the billboard, professional welding and construction quality, diagonal support cables or beams ensuring stability, foundation visible at base showing professional concrete work and safety barriers, maintenance ladder with safety cage on the back side (partially visible), and professional lighting fixtures (if backlit) or weathering appropriate to installation age. The sky is dramatic and characteristic of Deccan Plateau weather: brilliant clear blue (Pantone 298C equivalent) typical of South Indian late afternoon, absolutely cloudless expanse showing the region's semi-arid climate, subtle heat haze visible rising from the black asphalt highway creating atmospheric distortion in the distance, and the beginning of the golden hour with sunlight taking on a warmer tone (4800K color temperature) casting long shadows. The highway scene captures authentic Hyderabad ORR traffic during IT corridor rush hour: six-lane divided highway (three lanes each direction) with smooth asphalt showing recent construction quality, white and yellow road markings in excellent condition, metal crash barriers (painted blue and white) separating the lanes, and realistic traffic flow. Vehicles include: white Toyota Innova with IT company sticker carrying professionals home from work, black Honda City sedan in the fast lane, orange and black auto-rickshaw (characteristic Hyderabad style) with passengers, multiple motorcycles and scooters (Honda Activa, Royal Enfield) with riders wearing helmets, Volvo and Ashok Leyland company buses with IT company branding (TCS, Infosys, Google visible), vegetable vendor's three-wheeler tempo with produce visible, and a mix of other sedans, SUVs, and commercial vehicles creating realistic traffic density without appearing too congested. Show realistic vehicle details: metallic paint reflecting the afternoon sun creating highlights and reflections, slight motion blur on vehicles (1/500s freezes most action but shows some wheel rotation), realistic license plates (TS registration for Telangana state), varied vehicle colors representing India's automotive market, and natural spacing and lane discipline typical of ORR traffic. The background reveals authentic Gachibowli IT corridor landscape: modern glass and steel office buildings (15-20 story towers) of major tech companies with recognizable architecture (Microsoft, Amazon, Google Hyderabad campuses), the distinctive curved glass facade of DLF Cyber City, construction cranes indicating ongoing development, characteristic red soil of Hyderabad visible on undeveloped plots, rocky outcrops typical of the Deccan Plateau, scattered neem and eucalyptus trees, and the urban sprawl of Hyderabad's tech hub extending to the horizon. The lighting creates dramatic impact: late afternoon sun at 40-degree angle casting long shadows from the unipole structure stretching across the highway (shadow approximately 25m long), strong sidelighting on the billboard making colors vibrant and creating dimensional depth, backlighting on passing vehicles creating rim lights and highlights on their metallic surfaces, heat haze distortion creating a subtle atmospheric effect in the distance, and the characteristic clear, high-contrast lighting of South Indian weather. Include authentic environmental details: roadside elements like kilometer markers, highway signage (showing distances to Gachibowli, HITEC City, Airport), solar-powered street lights awaiting evening activation, boundary walls with advertising restrictions in place, the characteristic red Deccan soil visible on the roadside, utility poles and power lines, and the professional landscaping typical of ORR maintenance standards. The composition emphasizes scale and dominance: the unipole positioned slightly off-center following the rule of thirds, creating a dynamic diagonal line from bottom-left to top-right, the highway leading lines drawing the eye through the frame and emphasizing depth, the billboard dominating the upper portion of the frame against the clean blue sky with the complete advertisement design clearly readable, and the vehicles providing human scale reference making the structure's size apparent. Atmospheric elements add realism: slight lens flare from the late afternoon sun (controlled and subtle), dust particles visible in the air near the road surface catching light, heat distortion creating shimmer effects above the dark asphalt, and realistic color grading emphasizing the warm afternoon light while maintaining the billboard's color accuracy and design clarity. The image must feel powerful, epic, and cinematic - comparable to high-end automotive commercials or luxury brand advertising campaigns. The billboard should appear as a dominant landmark on the highway displaying a complete professional advertisement (logo + tagline + visuals + design elements), commanding attention from travelers while integrating naturally into Hyderabad's modern infrastructure landscape. The photograph should demonstrate the massive reach and impact of this advertising medium while capturing the energy, scale, and modernity of India's technology capital - creating an image that appeals to premium brands seeking high-visibility advertising placement with full creative expression.",

        prompt: "Professional night photography and urban documentation: Cinematic shot of a massive curved LED digital billboard at the prominent intersection of Linking Road and SV Road in Bandra West, Mumbai, captured at 9:15 PM approximately 20 minutes after a heavy monsoon downpour. Shot using a Sony A7S III (renowned for low-light performance) with a 35mm f/1.4 lens at f/1.8, ISO 3200, 1/60s to balance the brilliant LED display with the ambient street lighting while allowing enough exposure for the rain-soaked environment. The camera is positioned across the street at ground level, approximately 25 meters from the billboard, creating a dynamic perspective that captures both the LED screen's dominance and the bustling street life below. The LED billboard is a state-of-the-art digital display: massive curved screen (15m width x 8m height, gentle convex curve following the building's architecture), using high-resolution LED panels (6mm pixel pitch) capable of displaying vibrant colors with exceptional brightness (8,000 nits), currently showing a COMPLETE PROFESSIONAL DIGITAL BILLBOARD ADVERTISEMENT CAMPAIGN captured at the peak of the animation sequence. The digital advertisement should feature: the provided logo as the dominant centerpiece (6m x 4m) with optional animated entrance effect (elegant reveal, smooth zoom, or fade-in), a powerful brand tagline or key marketing message in massive, bold typography (2m letter height) readable from blocks away, eye-catching motion graphics elements including dynamic color gradients, animated patterns, particle effects, or smooth transitions that enhance the message without overwhelming, stunning high-resolution lifestyle imagery or product photography showing the brand's positioning, and optional call-to-action with website or QR code. The advertisement displays in brilliant, saturated colors with perfect color calibration - vibrant hues specifically optimized for night visibility creating dramatic contrast against the dark, wet Mumbai street, with the complete design flowing through a 15-30 second animation loop that captures attention and communicates the brand story. The screen shows realistic digital display characteristics: individual LED modules subtly visible at this distance, slight moiré pattern typical of LED screens when photographed, perfect brightness uniformity across the entire surface, and the characteristic glow that LED screens emit creating a halo effect in the humid post-rain atmosphere. The wet streets create spectacular visual drama: the black asphalt road surface transformed into a mirror-like reflective surface from the recent downpour, perfect reflections of the LED billboard creating an inverted duplicate image in the street with colors slightly more muted and diffused by the water ripples, reflections of the surrounding neon signs creating a colorful tapestry of light on the wet pavement, puddles of various sizes reflecting the lights creating varied reflection patterns, and the water surface showing subtle distortions from passing vehicles creating dynamic light patterns. The scene captures authentic post-monsoon Mumbai street life: three auto-rickshaws (two black-and-yellow, one older model in Mumbai's traditional yellow and green livery) with their distinctive design waiting at the intersection, their metallic surfaces wet and reflecting the colorful lights, drivers in rain-dampened shirts waiting for passengers; groups of pedestrians navigating the wet streets: young professionals in Western business casual clothing (jeans, shirts, some carrying laptop bags) returning from Bandra's co-working spaces, women in colorful rain gear (bright pink, yellow, and blue rain jackets and kurtas) with plastic bags protecting their shopping, families with children wearing matching raincoats and carrying umbrellas, and elderly residents in traditional Mumbai attire (men in simple shirts and trousers, women in cotton sarees with pallu covering their heads) carefully stepping around puddles. The characteristic architecture of Bandra creates the backdrop: Art Deco buildings (1930s-era construction) with their distinctive geometric facades, curved balconies, and pastel colors (cream, pink, and yellow) now darkened by rain and illuminated by street lights; ground floor retail spaces showing the vibrant Mumbai commercial character - a Goli Vada Pav stall with its distinctive red and yellow signage, customers huddled under the makeshift plastic sheet shelter eating hot snacks with steam rising from the food; a Rajesh Textiles shop with colorful fabric displays visible through the glass windows; Cafe Monza with its neon sign and patrons visible inside; and various small shops with glowing signs in Hindi, Marathi, and English creating a riot of colors. Include authentic environmental details that capture post-monsoon Mumbai: steam rising from the warm pavement (asphalt retaining daytime heat meeting cool rain creating visible vapor in the humid air), visible droplets on shop awnings with water still dripping, the characteristic humidity creating a slight haze in the air that diffuses and scatters light sources, wet leaves on the few neem trees lining the street catching reflections, and the fresh, clean atmosphere immediately after rain contrasting with Mumbai's usual dense air. The lighting creates a cinematic, moody atmosphere: the LED billboard as the dominant light source casting vibrant colored light across the scene (blue and orange tones from the advertisement illuminating the nearest building facades and street), surrounding neon signs contributing ambient light (restaurant signs in red and green, shop signs in various colors, street vendors' lights in warm yellow), LED street lights (4000K) providing functional illumination creating pools of light along the sidewalk, headlights from passing vehicles creating dynamic moving light sources, and the interplay of colored reflections on the wet surfaces creating a complex, layered lighting design. Show realistic photographic effects typical of night urban photography: bokeh in the background created by the f/1.8 aperture transforming distant lights (traffic signals, vehicle headlights, shop signs) into beautiful circular orbs of color, slight lens flare from the intense LED screen creating authentic diffraction patterns (cross-pattern or burst effect) adding to the cinematic quality, chromatic aberration visible around high-contrast edges (slight color fringing) adding to the authentic feel, natural vignetting from the wide aperture darkening the corners slightly, and the characteristic noise pattern at ISO 3200 (controlled but visible, adding to the cinematic grain). The traffic and street activity creates dynamic energy: Maruti Suzuki Swift navigating through the intersection with headlights creating reflections on the wet road, BEST bus (Mumbai's characteristic red double-decker or standard red bus) with interior lights visible through windows showing passengers, motorcycles (Honda Activa scooters popular in Mumbai) with riders in rain gear creating light trails if they move during exposure, and pedestrians crossing at various points with umbrellas creating colorful accent points throughout the frame. Authentic Mumbai details add character: street vendors with illuminated glass carts selling chai and snacks, the steam from their kettles visible in the cool post-rain air; plastic sheets rigged as temporary rain protection over sidewalk merchandise; the characteristic concrete sidewalks with their uneven paving stones creating small puddles; municipal drainage grates with water still flowing; multilingual signage in Marathi, Hindi, and English; and the organized chaos of Mumbai street life even at night during monsoon season. The composition should emphasize scale and atmosphere: the curved LED billboard dominating the upper third of the frame, its vibrant colors contrasting with the darker surrounding architecture; the wet street in the lower third creating the spectacular reflection and leading lines; the middle third filled with human activity, vehicles, and street life providing scale and context; and the overall balance creating a sophisticated urban night scene. The image must capture the electric, vibrant energy of Mumbai after rain - the city coming alive at night despite the weather, the technological sophistication of modern digital advertising, and the authentic character of Bandra's street life. The photograph should have the cinematic quality of Bollywood establishing shots or high-end brand campaigns, with moody atmospheric lighting, perfect timing, and the organized chaos that defines Mumbai's unique urban character - creating an image that demonstrates both the massive visibility of digital LED advertising and the cultural richness of one of India's most iconic neighborhoods.",

        prompt: "Professional urban infrastructure advertising photography: Street-level shot of a busy urban junction in Hyderabad during late afternoon (3:16 PM), capturing TWO large horizontal billboards mounted side-by-side on a concrete flyover/bridge structure. Shot using a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV with a 24-70mm f/2.8 lens at 45mm, f/8, ISO 400, 1/500s to maintain sharpness across both the billboards and the street traffic below while capturing the vibrant urban environment. The camera is positioned at street level approximately 50 meters from the junction, creating a perspective that shows the billboards from a driver's viewpoint—clearly visible and readable from the road below. The flyover structure is authentic Indian urban infrastructure: elevated concrete bridge/metro structure spanning across a multi-lane highway junction, massive concrete support pillars with infrastructure identification codes (like 'HYD-12A'), thick concrete beam construction forming the bridge deck, modern engineering with smooth gray concrete surfaces showing urban weathering and age, safety railings visible along the bridge edges, and the characteristic robust construction typical of Indian metro/flyover systems. The billboards are mounted on the SIDE FACE of the bridge structure (NOT underneath, but on the vertical side panel facing the street): TWO identical large horizontal billboards positioned side-by-side along the bridge's side, each measuring approximately 20 meters width x 3 meters height, creating a total advertising span of approximately 40-45 meters with slight spacing between them. Both billboards display the SAME COMPLETE PROFESSIONAL ADVERTISEMENT DESIGN, creating powerful brand repetition and maximum visibility. The advertisement design features: the provided logo as the dominant centerpiece (displayed prominently on both billboards, approximately 8m x 2m on each), bold brand tagline or key marketing message in large, clean typography readable from highway distances (minimum 50cm letter height), vibrant color palette using brand colors with sophisticated backgrounds and gradients, complementary design elements including lifestyle imagery, product photos, or modern graphic patterns creating visual interest, contact information (phone number or website) strategically placed, and the overall professional billboard design following outdoor advertising best practices—minimal text, high-contrast colors, clear visual hierarchy, and immediate visual impact. The billboard material is professional outdoor advertising grade: weatherproof vinyl or flex print material with UV-resistant lamination, mounted on steel frame structures with professional installation hardware, vibrant Pantone-matched colors showing excellent saturation and clarity even in bright daylight, clean edges with professional finishing and secure mounting, and the overall appearance of recent installation with no tears, fading, or damage. The street-level scene captures authentic Indian urban traffic during peak hours: wide multi-lane highway junction (4-5 lanes in each direction) with smooth asphalt showing typical road texture and wear, clearly visible white lane markings including zebra crossings and directional arrows, diverse vehicle mix creating realistic Indian traffic patterns—white sedans (Maruti Dzire, Honda City), motorcycles (Hero, Bajaj, Royal Enfield) with riders, yellow-and-black auto-rickshaws in characteristic Indian design, buses (TSRTC or private services), and SUVs creating natural traffic flow. Vehicles show slight motion blur on wheels indicating movement while maintaining sharp body details. The left side of the frame features vibrant Indian street culture: roadside vendors with colorful stalls or mobile carts, pedestrians crossing or waiting at the junction including families, professionals, and students, typical urban elements like traffic signals, road signs in Telugu and English, and the characteristic organized chaos of Indian city intersections. The background reveals authentic Hyderabad urban landscape: modern glass-facade office buildings and tech company towers (characteristic of Hyderabad's IT corridor with blue-tinted glass and contemporary architecture), older mixed-use buildings showing the city's architectural diversity, visible signage in multiple languages, additional urban infrastructure including metro pillars or flyover structures creating depth, trees and urban greenery providing natural elements, and the characteristic dense urban environment of South Indian metropolitan areas. On the flyover structure itself, authentic details add realism: large painted advertisements visible on other surfaces including artistic murals or social messages (like the boxing figure visible in the reference), green shrubs or planted vegetation at the base of pillars and along the structure adding environmental elements, municipal infrastructure elements like drainage pipes and utility conduits, and the overall lived-in, active urban infrastructure appearance. The lighting creates ideal daytime advertising photography conditions: bright natural daylight (approximately 5500K color temperature) with partly cloudy skies creating even, diffused illumination without harsh shadows, the overcast conditions ensuring the billboard colors appear vibrant and saturated without glare or hotspots, soft ambient light illuminating the concrete structure showing its texture and weathering, natural highlights on vehicle surfaces showing their metallic finishes, and the characteristic bright, clear atmosphere of South Indian daytime with slight atmospheric haze in the distance creating depth. Include authentic urban atmospheric details: realistic color grading emphasizing the vibrant billboard colors while maintaining natural environmental tones, the billboards standing out prominently against the gray concrete structure creating strong visual contrast, perfect exposure balancing the bright billboards with the street-level details, slight dust or atmospheric haze characteristic of busy Indian highways visible in the distance, and the overall professional outdoor advertising photography quality. The composition emphasizes driver visibility and advertising effectiveness: both billboards prominently positioned in the upper-center portion of the frame, the street-level viewpoint demonstrating exactly how drivers and commuters would see the advertisements while approaching or passing through the junction, leading lines from the road lanes and traffic flow drawing the eye naturally toward the billboards, the human and vehicle scale providing context for the billboards' impressive size and visibility, and the overall balance between the advertising medium and the authentic urban environment. Show proper proportions and realistic scale: the billboards measuring approximately 20m x 3m each, positioned at optimal viewing height (approximately 8-10 meters above street level) ensuring visibility without being too high, the concrete bridge structure showing appropriate engineering scale with massive support pillars and thick deck beams, human figures and vehicles providing scale reference demonstrating the billboards' commanding presence, and the realistic integration of advertising infrastructure into existing urban development. The atmosphere must convey high-traffic, high-visibility premium advertising placement: the strategic location at a busy junction ensuring maximum eyeball exposure, the dual billboard repetition creating powerful brand reinforcement (commuters see the same brand message twice in immediate succession), the professional installation quality indicating premium advertising real estate, the authentic Indian urban context (modern tech hub, heavy traffic, diverse audience), and the overall demonstration of how bridge/flyover advertising creates unavoidable brand visibility for commuters. The image must showcase both the advertising medium's exceptional visibility (strategic side-mounting on bridge structure, optimal viewing angles from street level, dual billboard repetition, large format ensuring readability from distance) and the authentic Indian urban environment (busy highway junction, diverse traffic, modern cityscape, characteristic infrastructure). The photograph should have the quality of outdoor advertising agency portfolios or infrastructure advertising case studies, demonstrating to potential clients the massive reach and effectiveness of this advertising medium in capturing the attention of daily commuters in India's bustling metropolitan corridors—creating an image that proves the value of bridge/flyover billboard advertising for brands seeking maximum urban visibility and repeated exposure.",

Shot using a Canon EOS R5 with a 24-70mm f/2.8 lens at 50mm, f/5.6, ISO 400, 1/250s from approximately 8-10 meters distance to capture the COMPLETE FULL-LENGTH SIDE VIEW of the vehicle from front bumper to rear bumper without any cropping or cutting. The camera is positioned at exact side-on angle (90 degrees perpendicular to the car's length) at 1.3m height, ensuring the entire vehicle side is visible in one frame—front door, rear door, front fender, rear quarter panel—creating a comprehensive view perfect for showcasing the complete wrap design. The vehicle features a COMPLETE PROFESSIONAL VEHICLE WRAP ADVERTISEMENT on the side panel with the provided logo prominently displayed on the front door as the main focal point (approximately 70cm x 45cm), scaled appropriately to fit the door's dimensions while maintaining correct proportions and aspect ratio. The wrap design extends across the ENTIRE side of the vehicle creating a cohesive mobile billboard: the logo centered on the front door as the primary element, bold brand tagline or key message positioned on the rear door or rear quarter panel in clean, readable typography, vibrant gradient backgrounds or modern geometric patterns in brand colors flowing seamlessly from front to rear creating visual continuity, complementary design elements (abstract shapes, subtle product imagery, or decorative accents) enhancing the overall composition, and optional contact information (website or phone number) integrated tastefully. The wrap shows professional installation quality: perfectly following the car's natural contours and body lines, seamless application around door handles and trim without covering them, glossy vinyl finish (cast vinyl with UV protection) creating realistic reflections of the surroundings, vibrant colors that pop against the white base paint, no bubbles or lifting edges, and the overall appearance of premium vehicle branding seen in professional Indian marketing campaigns. The wrap does NOT cover windows, mirrors, wheels, headlights, or taillights—only the body panels. The Indian urban setting provides authentic context: the car parked on a clean street in a busy market area (like Sarojini Nagar in Delhi or Commercial Street in Bangalore), colorful shop fronts visible in the background with signage in Hindi/regional languages and English, street vendors with bright stalls selling fruits or flowers adding vibrant colors, pedestrians in mix of traditional and modern Indian clothing walking on sidewalks, auto-rickshaws or motorcycles visible in the background creating depth, and typical Indian urban architecture (mix of old and modern buildings with characteristic balconies, awnings, and painted facades). The late afternoon lighting creates ideal conditions: warm natural sunlight (4000K) at 35-degree angle illuminating the car's side panel beautifully, creating soft highlights on the glossy wrap surface showing dimensional depth and professional finish, realistic reflections on the wrap showing surrounding buildings and sky with slight distortion following the car's curves, gentle shadows under the vehicle adding depth and grounding, and the characteristic warm, flattering light that enhances the wrap's colors while maintaining clarity. Include authentic details: the car positioned with full side profile clearly visible, proper perspective showing the vehicle's actual proportions without distortion, street elements like curb, paved road, and painted parking lines, people providing scale reference, and the overall vibrant, energetic atmosphere of Indian street commerce. The composition must show the COMPLETE vehicle from front to back without cutting off any portion: the entire side profile fills the horizontal frame comfortably with small margins on left and right (approximately 10% negative space on each side), the vertical framing shows from ground level to slightly above the roofline, and the overall composition creates a clean, professional product shot suitable for vehicle wrap portfolio presentations. The image should look like professional automotive advertising photography demonstrating the effectiveness and visual impact of vehicle wrap advertising in authentic Indian urban environments—perfect for showing potential clients the complete wrap design execution and real-world application.",

The camera is positioned at approximately 1.4m height, 8 meters from the promotional tent, creating a dynamic perspective that captures both the brand activation setup and the vibrant beach atmosphere. The promotional auto canopy tent is the centerpiece: professional pop-up canopy tent (3m x 3m footprint, 3m peak height) with heavy-duty aluminum frame and commercial-grade WHITE or LIGHT-COLORED polyester canopy (pure white, off-white, or light cream base color ensuring maximum brand visibility and color contrast), fully branded with a COMPLETE PROFESSIONAL ADVERTISEMENT DESIGN.

The bright coastal sunlight creates ideal event photography conditions: intense South Indian sun (approximately 5800K color temperature) at 60-degree angle creating strong directional light with high contrast, crisp shadows cast by the tent structure and people on the sand and pavement adding dimension, the tent's branded canopy creating shaded area underneath with cooler, diffused light (approximately 1-2 stops darker than exterior), natural highlights on the tent's polyester material showing its texture and professional printing quality, reflections on ambassadors' sunglasses and shiny branded materials, and the characteristic bright, cheerful atmosphere of midday coastal events. Show realistic environmental conditions: coastal breeze visible in the movement of branded flags and banners (slight motion blur showing wind movement), ambassadors' hair and clothing showing subtle wind effects, tent canopy showing slight movement but secure anchoring, heat haze visible in the distance over the hot sand creating atmospheric distortion, and the characteristic humid atmosphere of Chennai's coast with slightly hazy sky near the horizon.
