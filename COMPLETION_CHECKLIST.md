- [x] Automatic retry without user intervention

### Implementation
- [x] Enhanced `generateWithRetry` function
- [x] Exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s, max 60s
- [x] 10 retry attempts (exceeds requirement)
- [x] Callback for max attempts reached
- [x] Automatic retry with intelligent delays

### Verification
- [x] Retry logic tested

---

## Requirement 3: Smart Image Loading

### Requirements
- [x] Wait for images to fully load
- [x] Validate before displaying
- [x] Only show successfully loaded images
- [x] Implement loading states

### Implementation
- [x] Created `validateImageUrl` function
- [x] Image validation with 10-second timeout
- [x] Failed loads treated as errors and retried
- [x] Loading spinner persists until success
- [x] Only success status shows image

### Verification
- [x] Image validation function works
- [x] Timeout implemented
- [x] Failed images trigger retry
- [x] Loading states persist
- [x] Only valid images displayed

---

## Requirement 4: Graceful Fallback Handling

### Requirements
- [x] Skip failed images silently
- [x] Application continues functioning
- [x] Background retry queue
- [x] No error messages shown

### Implementation
- [x] Created `RetryQueue` service
- [x] Background processing every 5 seconds
- [x] Queue size limit (50 items)
- [x] Stale item removal (30 minutes)
- [x] Concurrent processing (3 items)
- [x] Status remains loading (never error)

### Verification
- [x] Queue system created
- [x] Background processing works
- [x] Memory safe (queue limited)
- [x] Stale items removed
- [x] Application continues functioning

---

## Requirement 5: Code Analysis

### Requirements
- [x] Analyze entire codebase
- [x] Identify error handling locations
- [x] Review Gemini API integration
- [x] Examine component rendering
- [x] Check API key rotation

### Analysis Completed
- [x] Reviewed `App.tsx` - main retry logic
- [x] Reviewed `components/ImageDisplay.tsx` - error display
- [x] Reviewed `services/geminiService.ts` - API integration
- [x] Reviewed `types.ts` - data structures
- [x] Reviewed `constants.ts` - product definitions
- [x] Verified API key rotation logic
- [x] Identified all error message sources

### Findings
- [x] Error messages in `generateWithRetry` (line 43)
- [x] Error display in `CardError` component
- [x] Error status in `GenerationResult` type
- [x] API key rotation working correctly
- [x] Rate limit handling in place

---
